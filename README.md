# ICS4UE Final Project

A Java Swing networking application by Harry Xu and Tommy Shan as the final project for the ICS4UE AP Computer Science course at Richmond Hill High School.
The software provides architecture for students to construct an artificial intelligence for a player in a game.
Users can connect to a host program and upload their program to the host, after which the host can start a game with the submitted player programs.
